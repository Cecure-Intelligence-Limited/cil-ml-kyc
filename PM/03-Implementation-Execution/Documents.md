Certainly, hereâ€™s a comprehensive breakdown of what weâ€™ve produced so far and how they stack up from a product perspective:

## ðŸ“„ Current Project Documents (PoC/MVP)

| Document                      | Status        | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| âœ… Project Charter             | Completed     | Captures objectives, scope, timeline, teams, risks, and success criteria    |
| âœ… Detailed Technical Design   | Completed     | Service architecture, flows, Lambda responsibilities, AWS resource mapping  |
| âœ… Technical Workstreams       | Completed     | Nine structured workstreams aligned to product phases and deliverables      |
| âœ… Test Plan                   | Completed     | Functional, negative, performance, security, and UI scenarios               |
| âœ… Monitoring Strategy         | Completed     | Metrics, logs, dashboards, alerts, roles, SLOs                              |
| âœ… AWS Resource Architecture   | Completed     | Low-level configurations for every service (API Gateway, S3, IAM, etc.)     |

## âœ… Product Coverage Assessment

From a **product/product perspective**, the documentation effectively covers:

- **Vision & Objectives** âœ”  
- **Scope Definition (MVP & V2)** âœ”  
- **User Journey & Flow Logic** âœ”  
- **Security & Compliance Considerations** âœ”  
- **Operational Readiness (monitoring, alerting)** âœ”  
- **Integration Interfaces (APIs, roles, env config)** âœ”  

Still to enrich (optional but recommended):

- ðŸŸ¡ *UI Wireframes*: to define screen layouts, gesture prompts, feedback messaging  
- ðŸŸ¡ *User Stories Mapping*: to connect backend flows to business goals  
- ðŸŸ¡ *Demo Script / Pitch Deck*: for internal stakeholder walkthrough or investor showcase  
- ðŸŸ¡ *Integration Guide for V2 Widget*: tailored developer doc for partners

## ðŸ“¦ Final Outputs: Artifacts & Deliverables

Hereâ€™s a snapshot of what the PoC/MVP will produce as tangible outputs:

### ðŸ”§ Technical Deliverables
- Source code (frontend SPA, backend Lambdas)
- API specification (OpenAPI / Swagger format)
- Infrastructure templates (Terraform/CloudFormation)
- Deployment pipelines (CI/CD config)
- Monitoring dashboards and alert configuration
- Test coverage report (unit, integration, e2e)
- Sample S3 artifacts: uploaded ID, liveness frames, OCR JSON
- Audit logs in DynamoDB with sample entries

### ðŸ“˜ Documentation Artifacts
- Project Charter  
- Technical Design Docs  
- Workstream Tracker or Roadmap  
- IAM Roles & Permissions Matrix  
- Secrets and Configuration Inventory  
- Monitoring & SLO Dashboards  
- Integration Guide for V2 KYC Widget  
- Test Plan and QA Summary

If youâ€™d like, we can wrap all of this into a clean deliverables checklist and define owners and delivery dates for each. Would that be helpful next? Or shall we move on to wireframes and user experience refinements?
