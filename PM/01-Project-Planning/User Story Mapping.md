Let’s level up with **User Story Mapping**—a crucial bridge between backend logic and actual product outcomes. This helps ensure that each technical flow corresponds to a meaningful user interaction and business goal.

## 🧭 User Story Mapping: MVP KYC Flow

Here’s a structured layout connecting **User Goals → Activities → Tasks → System Logic**:

### 🎯 User Goals
- Verify identity quickly and securely  
- Receive feedback immediately  
- Feel confident data is protected

### 🗺️ Activities & Tasks

| Activity                  | Task                                  | Backend/System Logic                            |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 📝 Start verification     | Open welcome screen, accept terms      | Create session ID, audit consent capture         |
| 📤 Submit ID              | Upload document (front/back)          | Save to S3, run OCR Lambda, validate structure   |
| 📸 Prove liveness         | Capture selfie with prompt            | Trigger facial movement detection, match ID face |
| ✔️ Confirm details        | Review auto-extracted info            | Retrieve OCR output, allow edits, confirm match  |
| 🚀 Complete flow          | See result, retry or finish           | Status update, push audit logs, close session    |

### 🔄 Edge/Alt Flows
- ❗ Upload fails → Retry screen with format tips  
- 🕶️ Poor lighting → UI feedback and retry selfie  
- 🔐 Data mismatch → Manual override or denial message
