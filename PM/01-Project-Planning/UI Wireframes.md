Perfect—starting with UI wireframes sets a solid foundation for everything downstream. Let’s make them product-smart and dev-friendly:

## 🖼️ UI Wireframes: MVP Objectives

These wireframes should help communicate:
- The **core user journey** from onboarding to completion  
- **Key interaction points** (e.g., photo upload, live selfie, consent acknowledgment)  
- **Validation states**: errors, feedback messages, retry options  
- **Responsive layout** for mobile vs desktop views  
- **Visual cues** for liveness detection prompts, document scan areas, etc.

## ✍️ Initial Wireframe Screens (suggested layout)

| Screen                     | Purpose                                      | Notes                                                                |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🚪 Entry / Welcome Screen  | Introduce KYC flow and privacy consent       | Logo, tagline, CTA to begin                                          |
| 📄 Upload Document         | Upload ID (front/back) with guidelines       | Drag/drop or camera input, example preview, format instructions      |
| 📷 Live Selfie Capture     | Real-time liveness selfie                    | On-screen prompt: "Turn your head slowly", feedback bar              |
| 📋 OCR Confirmation        | Extracted document data                      | Editable fields with confirm/reject buttons                          |
| 🧾 Summary Screen          | Final validation status                      | Progress bar, retry options, CTA for next steps                      |

Optional:  
- 🎨 Style Guide screen: Typography, color palette, button states  
- 🧩 Widget Preview (V2): For embeddable flows in partner apps

## 🧠 Next Steps: Collaboration Options

- **Do you want these wireframes visualised?** I can sketch them conceptually here or recommend a layout tool (Figma, Whimsical, Excalidraw).  
- **Shall we define interaction states and error handling next?** For instance: invalid file, network timeout, poor lighting, etc.  
- **Or jump to mapping these screens to user stories**, so backend flows are clearly aligned?

You lead, Tolulope. We make it clean, intuitive and dev-proof.
