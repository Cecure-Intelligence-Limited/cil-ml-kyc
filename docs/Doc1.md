Got it — I’ve gone through your research paper, and it’s packed with exactly the kind of detail we need to craft strong foundational documents.  
Let’s start by framing **two outputs** you can take straight into stakeholder discussions: a **Project Charter** to set the “why, what, and how” at a high level, and a **Product Scope** to clearly define your MVP boundaries for the Nigerian market.

---

## **1. Project Charter — KYC MVP (Nigeria Focus)**

**Project Title**  
_Nigerian SMB‑Focused KYC MVP_

**Project Purpose / Justification**  
Deliver a streamlined, regulation‑compliant KYC platform tailored for Nigerian SMBs, enabling them to meet the April 2024 CBN NIN/BVN linkage mandate, reduce onboarding friction, and mitigate fraud through accessible biometric and document verification.

**Objectives**
- Build a production‑ready KYC MVP integrated with **NIMC (NIN)** and **NIBSS (BVN)** databases.
- Offer **Biometric KYC**, **Document Verification**, and **Enhanced KYC (data enrichment)** in modular form.
- Prioritize **developer experience** with robust REST API, Android SDK, and Flutter SDK.
- Launch with transparent, usage‑based pricing and a self‑service onboarding model.

**Scope (High Level)**
- ✅ In: Core biometric verification, document verification for fallback, enhanced KYC lookup, REST API, Android & Flutter SDKs, developer sandbox & docs.  
- ❌ Out: AML watchlist screening, KYB, iOS SDK, voter/driver’s license authoritative checks (post‑MVP roadmap).

**Key Stakeholders**
- **Project Sponsor:** Executive/Founder team
- **Product Owner:** [Name/Role]
- **Technical Lead:** [Name/Role]
- **Compliance Advisor:** Specialist in Nigerian AML/KYC laws
- **Pilot Clients:** Targeted SMBs in fintech (digital lending, neobanks)

**Milestones**
- **Week 0‑2:** Requirements refinement & technical design
- **Week 3‑8:** Core feature development & integration with NIMC/NIBSS
- **Week 9‑10:** Internal QA & compliance checks
- **Week 11‑12:** Pilot program launch with select SMBs
- **Week 13+:** Iterate based on feedback, prep for full market release

**Risks & Mitigation**
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Delays in NIMC/NIBSS integration approvals | High | Engage early, parallelize compliance documentation |
| Regulatory changes mid‑build | Medium | Maintain legal watch, modular architecture for quick updates |
| Adoption friction for SMBs | High | Prioritize self‑service onboarding, free tier |

**Success Criteria**
- Pilot clients can integrate in < 1 week
- ≥95% match rate for biometric verification in pilot
- Zero major compliance issues at audit

## **2. Product Scope — KYC MVP (Nigeria)**

**Product Vision**  
_To empower Nigerian SMBs with a fast, compliant, and developer‑friendly identity verification toolkit that turns regulatory burden into a competitive edge._

**Target Market**  
- Nigerian SMBs in fintech and adjacent sectors (digital lenders, neobanks, investment platforms).
- Businesses impacted by CBN’s NIN/BVN mandate and three‑tier KYC framework.

**User Needs**
- Fast, frictionless onboarding to reduce customer drop‑off.
- Simplified compliance without dedicated compliance teams.
- Affordable, transparent pricing without enterprise‑style sales friction.

**Core MVP Features**
1. **Biometric KYC**
   - NIN/BVN lookup from NIMC/NIBSS
   - Liveness detection
   - 1:1 biometric match against government photo
2. **Document Verification**
   - OCR & authenticity checks for IDs (Driver’s License, Voter’s Card, NIN Slip)
   - Biometric match against document photo
3. **Enhanced KYC (Data Enrichment)**
   - Structured JSON with full personal details for Tier 1–3 onboarding workflows

**Technical Scope**
- REST API with secure endpoints
- Android SDK (Kotlin) & Flutter SDK
- Developer sandbox & comprehensive documentation
- Mobile-first capture modules optimized for low‑bandwidth environments

**Exclusions (for Post‑MVP)**
- AML/PEP watchlist screening
- KYB verification
- iOS/React Native SDKs
- No‑code verification links

**Constraints**
- Must comply with Nigerian AML/CFT regulations & three‑tier KYC requirements.
- Initial integrations limited to NIMC & NIBSS.

**Acceptance Criteria**
- All core workflows function in both sandbox and production environments.
- End‑to‑end verification in < 20 seconds under normal network conditions.
- API documentation rated “clear” or better in ≥90% of pilot feedback.

**Dependencies**
- API access & SLA from NIMC/NIBSS.
- Compliance approvals for handling identity data.
- Early SMB pilot partners for testing.
